# ü¶† COVID-19 Analysis with Tableau

Welcome to the **COVID-19 Analysis** repository! This project contains a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic, visualized using Tableau. The analysis aims to provide insights into the spread of the virus, its impact across different regions, and trends over time.

## üìñ Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of lives worldwide. Analyzing the data related to the pandemic can help in understanding the spread, identifying hotspots, and making informed decisions. This project leverages Tableau to create interactive visualizations that provide deep insights into the pandemic.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Explore data related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and more across different regions.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualize trends in the spread of the virus over time.
- **Geographical Insights**: Analyze the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and continents.

## üìä Dataset Information

The analysis is based on the **COVID-19 Dataset** provided in this repository. The dataset contains detailed information on COVID-19 cases, including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and more.

### Important: 
- **Extract the Dataset**: The dataset is provided in a compressed format (`COVID-19-Dataset.zip`). **You need to extract the dataset from the zip file** for Tableau to fetch data from it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yajasarora/COVID-19-Analysis.git
   cd COVID-19-Analysis
   ```

2. **Extract the Dataset**:
   - Navigate to the directory where `COVID-19-Dataset.zip` is located.
   - Extract the contents of the zip file using your preferred extraction tool.
   - Ensure the extracted files are in the same directory as your Tableau workbook.

3. **Open the Tableau Workbook**:
   - Double-click on `Covid-19 analysis.twb` to open the Tableau workbook.
   - Tableau will automatically connect to the extracted dataset and load the visualizations.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Explore Dashboards**: Once the workbook is open in Tableau, navigate through the various dashboards to explore different aspects of the COVID-19 data.
- **Filter Data**: Use the provided filters to narrow down the analysis based on specific countries, regions, or time periods.
- **Export Visualizations**: Tableau allows you to export the visualizations in various formats (PDF, Image, etc.) for reporting purposes.
